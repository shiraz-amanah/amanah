## Verified Mosques: 7-session plan

Sessions A–G, all required before launch.

- **Session A** ✅ — Public listing + detail pages, mock data, geo-sort, save support
- **Session B** ✅ — Heart mosques (extend `saves` table to `item_type='mosque'`, "My Mosques" tab in UserDashboard)
- **Session C** — Mosque dashboard editing (Profile, Prayer times Iqama editor, location switcher for multi-location orgs)
- **Session D** — Events/programs (mosque dashboard CRUD + "What's happening" section on mosque detail)
- **Session E** — Home page "What's happening near you" aggregated events feed
- **Session F** — Donate-to-mosque flow (`processDonation()` abstraction with mock now / Stripe later, Gift Aid checkbox, anonymous toggle)
- **Session G** — Supabase migration (`mosques`, `mosque_admins`, `mosque_events` tables) + Aladhan API for Adhan times

---

## Data model decisions

- **Path B+**: organisation account → many-to-many → mosque locations
- Future tables: `mosques`, `mosque_admins`, `mosque_events`
- `saves` table is polymorphic via `item_type` — currently allows `'scholar'`, `'campaign'`, `'mosque'`
- Iqama times: mosque-self-reported via mosque dashboard
- Adhan times: Aladhan API (deferred to Session G)
- Stripe deferred but architected via `processDonation()` function — mock now, real later

---

## Architectural patterns established

### Shared sign-in handler

- Define `handleSignIn` ONCE in App component, just above the view router (around line 8064 in `App.jsx`)
- Pass as reference (`onSignIn={handleSignIn}`) to every page — never inline `onSignIn={(r) => {...}}`
- Logic: `prayer` → prayerHub, `user` → userDashboard if authed else userAuth, others → setRole + login
- Same pattern should apply to any future shared handler (e.g. `handleLogoClick`, `handleSave`)

### Shared PublicHeader component

- `<PublicHeader>` takes `authedUser`, `authedProfile`, `onLogoClick`, `onSignIn`
- Has internal `drawerOpen` state + `<AudienceDrawer>` rendered as Fragment sibling
- Used on every public page (home, mosques listing, mosque detail, scholar detail, etc.) — single source of truth for top nav
- `<AudienceDrawer>` extracted as separate component above `<PublicHeader>`, also reused independently

### Browser back behaviour

- Never hardcode `onBack={() => setView("publicHome")}` — fights the browser's actual history stack
- Use `onBack={() => window.history.back()}` so in-app back matches browser back button

### Tab persistence across navigation

Local component state dies on unmount/remount (e.g. when going to a detail page and back). For tabs that should survive navigation, wrap `useState` with sessionStorage:

```jsx
const [tab, setTabRaw] = useState(() => sessionStorage.getItem("dashboardTab") || "bookings");
const setTab = (newTab) => { sessionStorage.setItem("dashboardTab", newTab); setTabRaw(newTab); };
```

When renaming a tab's user-facing label, **keep the underlying value** (the `v:` field in the nav array) the same so existing users' sessionStorage entries don't get reset to default. The "Saved" → "My scholars" rename in Session B kept value `"saved"` for this reason.

### State shape duality

When the same data needs two shapes — a Set for fast membership checks and an array of full objects for rendering — keep both updated **atomically inside the toggle function**. Don't rely on a `useEffect` to refetch on dependency change; it creates a timing window where the UI is stale.

Asymmetric exception: when one side of a polymorphic relationship is static client data (e.g. `MOCK_MOSQUES` until DB migration), a Set alone is fine — derive the array on-demand via `MOCK_MOSQUES.filter(m => savedMosqueIds.has(String(m.id)))`. Document the asymmetry; revisit when migrating.

### Async useEffect pattern

Every async useEffect needs `.catch` and `.finally`:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  fetchSomething()
    .then(data => setData(data))
    .catch(err => console.error("context:", err))
    .finally(() => setLoading(false));
}, []);
```

Without `.catch`, errors are invisible. Without `.finally`, loading flags hang forever.

## Session A — Verified Mosques scaffolding ✅ (2 May 2026)

### What shipped

- `MOCK_MOSQUES` array — 8 UK mosques with real coordinates (Birmingham Central, East London, Manchester Central, Leeds Grand, Bradford Grand, Glasgow Central, Cardiff Madina, Leicester Central)
- `haversineDistance(lat1, lng1, lat2, lng2)` helper
- `useGeolocation()` custom hook — manual-trigger, returns `{coords, status, requestLocation}`
- `<MosqueCard>`, `<MosquesListing>`, `<MosqueDetail>` components
- App routing for `view === "mosquesListing"` and `view === "mosqueDetail"`
- "Verified mosques near you" section on PublicHome between Categories and Recent booking review
- Shared `handleSignIn` function (this session's main extraction work)
- `<PublicHeader>` and `<AudienceDrawer>` extracted as shared components

### Commits

- `50c208d` — Verified Mosques scaffolding
- `1ffcd48` — Sign-in `returnView` fix (added `returnView` state, captured before unauthed user redirect to `userAuth`, restored on `onComplete`; logged-in avatar click still goes to `userDashboard` unchanged)

### Lessons learned

- **Missing `/>` on long single-line JSX swallows the next line.** When replacing a route line like `<MosquesListing ... onSignIn={handleSignIn} />` with a fresh signature, dropping the closing `/>` makes Babel parse into the next route and report the error on the wrong line. The error pointed at line 8139 but the bug was on 8138. Fix: always re-view the line after a swap and confirm it ends with `/>;`.

- **Three-change pattern for shared header drops.** Each public page needs (1) header JSX swap to `<PublicHeader />`, (2) component signature updated to accept `authedUser`, `authedProfile`, `onSignIn`, (3) router line updated to pass those three props plus `handleSignIn`. Skipping any one of them produces silent failures — usually "the header looks unchanged on this one page but works elsewhere."

- **Handler signatures with wrong defaults are bugs, not features.** `CategoryListing` and `AllCampaigns` had `onClick={() => onSignIn("mosque")}` hardcoded — a button labelled "Sign in" that always sent users into the mosque auth flow regardless of who they were. Replacing with `handleSignIn` (which opens the audience picker drawer) is a UX fix, not just a refactor.

- **Removing inline handlers leaves orphaned code.** When replacing `onSignIn={(r) => { ...10 lines... }}` with `onSignIn={handleSignIn}`, the 10 lines of body must be deleted explicitly — they don't go anywhere automatically. After the replace, the `}}` closer becomes orphaned JSX and breaks the build. Always re-view the area after the swap and clean up any leftover lines.

## Session B — Mosque heart saves ✅ (2 May 2026)

### What shipped

- `savedMosqueIds` state + `toggleMosqueSave` handler in App component, mirroring `savedScholarIds`/`toggleScholarSave` pattern with optimistic update + rollback
- Heart icons wired on `<MosqueCard>` at all three render sites: PublicHome's "Verified mosques near you", `<MosquesListing>`, `<MosqueDetail>`
- "Saved" tab renamed to "My scholars" (label-only — sessionStorage value `"saved"` preserved)
- Saved campaigns moved out of the Saved tab into "My giving" as a new "Causes I'm watching" section above "All donations"
- New "My Mosques" tab in UserDashboard between My scholars and Messages, showing hearted mosques as a `<MosqueCard>` grid with empty state and un-save support
- DB migration: extended `saves_item_type_check` constraint to allow `'mosque'`

### Final tab order

`Bookings · My giving · My scholars · My Mosques · Messages · Account`

### Commits

- `885be66` — `feat(mosques): add savedMosqueIds state and toggleMosqueSave handler`
- `434a6a0` — `feat(mosques): wire heart save props through MosquesListing, MosqueDetail, PublicHome` (also includes the DB constraint migration)
- `c743c79` — `feat(mosques): add My Mosques tab to UserDashboard, restructure Saved`

### Architectural decisions (revisit at Session G)

- `savedMosqueIds` is a Set only — no parallel `savedMosques` array (asymmetric with `savedScholars`). Mosques are filtered on-demand via `MOCK_MOSQUES.filter(m => savedMosqueIds.has(String(m.id)))`. This works because mosques are static client data. When Session G migrates mosques to Supabase, add the array state then.
- Tab value `"saved"` kept for the "My scholars" tab — the rename is label-only — to avoid resetting users' `dashboardTab` sessionStorage value.
- Saved campaigns relocated to "My giving" (under "Causes I'm watching") rather than getting a dedicated tab. Reasoning: scholars and mosques become parallel "people/places I'm tracking" tabs; campaigns fit thematically with donations.

### Lessons learned

- **Polymorphic CHECK constraints need updating per new type.** The `saves` table's `item_type` column has a CHECK constraint listing allowed values. When extending to a new type (e.g. `'mosque'`), the SQL is:

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE saves DROP CONSTRAINT saves_item_type_check;
    ALTER TABLE saves ADD CONSTRAINT saves_item_type_check
      CHECK (item_type IN ('scholar', 'campaign', 'mosque'));
    ```

    Symptom of forgetting: hearts flash filled then unfill (optimistic update fires, then rollback fires when the DB returns 400). Diagnostic: DevTools Network tab → filter `saves` → click failed request → Preview tab shows `code: "23514"` (Postgres check-constraint violation) and `message: "...violates check constraint \"saves_item_type_check\""`.

- **Pre-scaffolding component signatures pays off.** `<MosqueCard>`, `<MosquesListing>`, and `<MosqueDetail>` were built in Session A already accepting `isSaved` and `onToggleSave` props (with no-op defaults). Session B's wiring work was therefore router-line-only at three sites — no need to also touch component internals. Worth doing prospectively when scaffolding any reusable card/list/detail trio.

## Session C — Mosque dashboard editing (planned)

Mosque admins can currently sign up but their dashboard is a stub. Session C adds:

- **Profile editor** — name, address, phone, photo, facilities (parking, wudu, disability access, women's area, etc.), affiliated scholars, linked campaign
- **Prayer times editor** — Iqama times for the five daily prayers + Jumu'ah, with day-of-week overrides
- **Location switcher** — for multi-location organisations (one account → multiple mosque listings)

Out of scope for Session C: events, donations to specific mosques, mosque-to-user messaging. Those are separate sessions (D, F, and TBD respectively).

## Cross-cutting gotchas

### Find/replace gotchas

- **Literal `\n` in find/replace.** VS Code find/replace does NOT expand `\n` to newlines unless regex mode is on. When pasting multi-line replacements via tooling, watch for literal `\n` strings appearing in code. Manual line breaks are safer than hoping escape sequences expand.
- **Find/replace on long single-line JSX signatures.** Components like `<PublicHome ... />` may have all props on one line. A replace targeting a prop in the middle can swallow neighbouring props. Always view the full line first, replace with full surrounding context.
- **Long single-line signatures sometimes have other declarations crammed after the opening `{`.** When find-and-replacing a function signature, watch for code piggybacking on the same line. The error surfaces as a ReferenceError in the browser, not a build error, because the JSX parses fine — the variable just doesn't exist at runtime.

### Debugging gotchas

- **When a fetch never fires (Network tab silent), suspect missing useEffect** rather than failed network. A failed fetch shows up in Network with red. A non-existent fetch is invisible.
- **Read the actual file in production.** When debugging a deployed site, verify `main.jsx`'s import path matches the file you're editing. Don't trust assumptions.
- **Check git diff before committing whitespace-looking changes.** A "blank-looking" diff might actually be a missing closing quote.

## Pre-mosques saga (April 2026) — kept for context

Spent hours debugging "Top-rated scholars" stuck on skeletons. Root cause: a `useEffect` that never got wired up to call `getScholars()`. State and loading flag existed; the fetch didn't.

**Why it took so long:** had two near-identical ~7400-line files (`App.jsx` and `amanah-prototype.jsx`) drifting from each other. `main.jsx` imported the prototype while edits were going into `App.jsx` — every "fix" was going into dead code. Resolved by deleting `App.jsx`, renaming prototype → `App.jsx`, pointing `main.jsx` at it.

**Rule that came out of it:** never have two copies of the same component file. If refactoring, finish the migration in one go and delete the old one. Drift is silent and expensive.

## Parked items (address before launch but not blocking next session)

- **"View all" button under "What do you need?"** on PublicHome (around the categories section) has no `onClick` handler. There's no "all categories" page currently — needs a destination decision (scroll-to-scholars? new page? remove button?).
- **Trim remaining debug `console.log` lines** once confident things are stable.
- **Consider splitting `App.jsx`** (~8200 lines) into separate component files. Becoming unwieldy.
- **Add a smoke-test suite** — even one per page would have caught the original scholars-not-loading bug in 5 seconds.
